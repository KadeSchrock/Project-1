# Security Statement

In order for the website to function, security must be considered to ensure functionality and keep information protected.
## The Website
1) The website as a whole will utilize input validation to prevent users from causing certain functionalities to break. 
2) The website will also ensure that any user attempting to access the site is human through basic authentication.
3) The website will log user activity for active security considerations which will be reviewed to ensure no bugs or security breaches occur.
## The Payment System
1) Users will be able to enter contact information and payment information. To prevent this data from being scraped or stolen, encryption must be applied when data is being stored and anything that attempts to access this information must be screened and authenticated in order to ensure only the company can utilize this information upon user purchase.
2) Information will be sent to the company encrypted so the company system will decrypt the information to process payment info.
## Interactivity
1) Any interactive element within the website will each perform one specific task to ensure users do not overload the system.
2) Users will be limited to specific actions within the website.
