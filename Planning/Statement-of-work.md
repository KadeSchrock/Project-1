For this project are intent is to make a snowboard website with several basic functionalities. We want to create a few basic webpages that each have a separate purpose. We want the user to have a seamless experience navigating between the pages and viewing our products. From the products page we want to make a shopping cart system that keeps track of the users additions to the carts across all of the websites webpages. The final addition we want to develop is a checkout system where the user can input payment methods. Finally we expect to host the website on our server using TrueNas.
