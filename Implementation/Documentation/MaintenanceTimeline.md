As stated in the overview maintainence must be undergone anytime a change is made to the code based so that our customers can see it in the web. End of support will be after our final presentation. We completed what we set out to do and no longer need to maintain the website so we will be removing any support for it very soon after out project is done. End of life will be when we decide to use the web domain for something else.
