Maintenance overview is pretty simple with our website. Due to the limited scope of our project we designed it in a way that minimum maintenance would be required. However There are a couple things that would need to me maintained if the website is to stay up.

1. Code updates
	Code must be maintained and updated while new features are being added, any changes to the code base would have to be pushed to the 	GitHub repository
2. Infrastructure (Self Hosting)
	Whenever any update is made to the website as it sits currently, a manual recreation of the DockerCompose.yml file has to be updated 	within TrueNas so that the new changes and effects can be seen when accessing the website on a web browser
